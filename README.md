# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Singapore is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Asia. Most tourists are exposed to the typical tourist attractions like Sentosa and Zoo. Event Finda provides a unique range of events happening in Singapore, from exhibition for kids to dine & wine events for adults. However, their website is not the easiest to navigate and to find the events that are of interest to visitors.

This chatbot agent is created to introduce these unique events to tourists in a more interactive way. Tourists can ask the chatbot to find them event based on keywords. Based on the keywords provided by the tourists, our chatbot is also capable of recommending other events that the tourists might be interested in, based on their search so far with the chatbot. Even locals can ask our chatbot for event recommendation. 

Creation of the dialog intent with a good list of training phrases, has been a never ending task as we test proof the agent. We found that if we keep the training phrase too simple, the DialogFlow is unable to clearly identify the correct intent, often end up triggering the wrong intent. If we added too many entities in a single phrase, Dialogflow canâ€™t match the intent and end up in the fallback intent.

The next biggest challenge is the integration to Google assistant. Documentation from both DialogFlow and Actions on Google is not detailed enough. And the lack of documentation for DialogFlow V2 API is also causing us a lot of time in debugging the code, instead of training our chatbot.

Eventually, we managed to get the basics working and able to successfully deploy a working chatbot agent. There are still test scenarios where the chatbot is unable to detect the intent. With more time, we can enhance the agent.

    - Mark webapps folder as Source Root, 
    - setup Project Interpreter with existing VirtualEnv" 
    - debug server.py
    - note: uses pycharm 2019.1.x. pycharm 2019.2.x needs to comments out server.py in pydevd_dont_trace_files.py under pycharm program folder. Refers bug report, https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-37609
